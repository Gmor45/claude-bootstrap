description: Load Gmor45's standing operating rules before doing anything else. Use at the START of every session on any surface — Claude Code, Cowork, or claude.ai chat — that touches a Gmor45 repository (claude-audit, Gartera-Vault, FusterCluck, Tangle, claude-usage-hud, DnD-Scheduler, cloudflare-deploy, wedding), any Obsidian vault, or anything involving git, commits, branches, pushing, pull requests, merging, GitHub Actions, model choice, thinking effort, session length, usage limits, or cost. Also use on "don't push to main", "am I using this right", "should I start a new chat", "why is this so expensive", or any callout of a repeated mistake. This skill does not contain the rules — it fetches them.

# Load the house rules

**This skill is a pointer, not the rules.** The rules live in a private
repository so they can stay specific without being public. This file's only job
is to go get them, so that a rule change pushed to that repo reaches every
surface without anyone pasting anything.

## Do this first, before answering

1. **Clone or pull the private repo** into this session's workspace:

   ```
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Gmor45/claude-audit.git
   # already present? then:  git -C claude-audit pull --ff-only
   ```

2. **Read the rules file in full:**

   ```
   claude-audit/.claude/skills/house-rules/SKILL.md
   ```

   Read the whole thing. Do not skim it, and do not act on a summary of it —
   it is the operating contract for every surface, and the failure it most
   often catches is a session that read *about* a thing instead of opening it.

3. **Follow it as if it had been loaded directly.** Everything in it applies:
   branch discipline, model and session-length guidance, the decisions
   register, the learning loop, the Thread, the braindump sweep.

4. **Also read, in the same repo, whichever of these the task touches:**

   | File | When |
   |---|---|
   | `.claude/skills/house-rules/DECISIONS.md` | Before asking him to re-affirm ANY design or process decision. Grep it first; if the ruling is there, act on it and cite it. |
   | `.claude/skills/night-shift/SKILL.md` | The nightly learning-loop procedure. |
   | `.claude/skills/handoff/SKILL.md` | Ending a session properly. |
   | `.claude/skills/braindump/SKILL.md` | A handwritten PDF, photo dump, or note export arrives. |
   | `.claude/skills/session-digest/SKILL.md` | The session/model audit. |

## If the clone fails

**Say so plainly and immediately. Do not proceed as if there were no rules.**

A session that silently continues without them is the exact failure this whole
arrangement exists to prevent — it will re-derive settled decisions, push to
`main`, and re-ask questions that were answered weeks ago, all while appearing
to work fine.

Known limits, so a failure is diagnosed rather than re-investigated:

- **claude.ai chat has no git.** It cannot clone anything. On that surface this
  skill cannot work, and the rules have to be pasted by hand. Say that rather
  than improvising.
- **A bare Cowork session has no credential for a private repo by default.**
  No `gh` CLI, no SSH key, and `GITHUB_TOKEN` (if set) is a placeholder string,
  not a real token. The clone in step 1 will fail with `fatal: could not read
  Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled` until a human
  supplies a credential — verified 2026-08-29 by cloning the *public*
  `claude-bootstrap` repo with the identical command and no auth needed in the
  same container, isolating the failure to "no credential," not a broken git
  setup. **Say this plainly rather than retrying the same clone command.** If
  Garrett is in the chat, ask him to paste a GitHub personal access token; splice
  it into the clone URL for that one command
  (`https://x-access-token:<PAT>@github.com/...`) rather than writing it to git
  config, so it is not left sitting in a file.
- **Push from Cowork is walled off by a known, open Anthropic bug — not a
  design choice, and not fixable with a better credential.** Verified
  2026-08-29: even with a working PAT that made the clone succeed, push was
  refused with `remote: access denied by the git proxy: <repo> is not in this
  session's authorized repository set`. This is tracked publicly and
  unresolved: [`anthropics/claude-code#76248`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/76248)
  (opened 2026-07-10, reproduced) and
  [`anthropics/claude-code#84581`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/84581)
  (opened 2026-08-06, broader — some sessions can't read *any* repo). Both
  errors tell the agent to call `add_repo` or "add the repository to the
  session's sources" — **no such tool or UI exists inside a Cowork session.**
  Do not spend a session debugging this or trying more credential shapes; the
  credential is not the problem once clone already works. If a push must
  happen, hand the finished work to a Claude Code session to push instead —
  crediting Cowork as author, never claiming it (see house rule 9 in the file
  this skill just fetched).
- **A private repo needs the session to be authorized for it.** If the clone is
  refused for a reason other than the credential issue above, that is a
  separate access problem, not a missing file. Report which it was.

## Why it is built this way

The rules must reach Claude Code, Cowork, and claude.ai alike. The only
account-level mechanism for that requires a **public** repository, and the rules
themselves are personal — they name how he works, what he spends, and his own
words about his mistakes. Publishing that to solve a sync problem is a bad
trade.

So the public half is this pointer, which contains nothing worth protecting, and
the private half stays private and is read live. A rule change pushed to
`claude-audit` is in force on the next session that loads this skill — no paste,
no copy to drift out of date.
